### Not-a-POS
 
 Project Description: 
 
A Point-of-Sale system that is web based instead of hardware based.   
It is a Heroku hosted ReactJS app that utilizes a MySQL database, Node Express routes, and MVC framework to display a user-created menu. 
 
 ### User Story:
 
When the user opens POS system , they will be able to login in with their unique pin, that would grant them access. 
User then will be able to place an order for either appetizers, drinks etc.. 
Once thatâ€™s placed, the cook(BOH) will be able to view the order and begin to cook. 

### Motivation:  

The motivation behind our project is knowing when a system like this fails, or stops functioning it can affect the user / and customer experience. 
Wanted to create something reliable and simple to use. 

### Technology/Framework Used:

NPM Package React, CSS-React Bootstrap, MySQL, Heroku, FastClick (for touch screen clicks), AccountingJS
